# DOFBOT Pro Robot Movement Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Current Status
- ‚úÖ I2C communication working
- ‚úÖ Serial connection working  
- ‚úÖ Hardware detected
- ‚ùå Robot not moving physically

## üéØ Most Likely Solutions

### 1. **Check Physical Safety Features**
Look for these on your DOFBOT Pro:
- **Emergency Stop Button**: Red button that needs to be released
- **Safety Switch**: Toggle switch labeled "SAFETY", "ENABLE", or "LOCK"
- **Mode Switch**: Switch between "MANUAL", "AUTO", "REMOTE" modes
- **Power Switch**: Main power switch that might need to be in "ON" position

### 2. **Power Supply Issues**
- Check if the robot is getting enough power (usually 12V)
- Look for power LED indicators
- Try power cycling the robot (turn off and on)
- Check all power cables and connections

### 3. **Servo Cable Connections**
- Verify all servo cables are properly connected
- Check for loose or damaged cables
- Ensure cables are connected to the correct servo ports

### 4. **Control Mode Issues**
The robot might be in the wrong control mode:
- **Manual Mode**: Robot only responds to physical buttons
- **Remote Mode**: Robot responds to computer commands
- **Auto Mode**: Robot runs pre-programmed sequences

### 5. **Software Initialization**
The robot might need a specific initialization sequence:
- Try power cycling the robot
- Check if there's a reset button
- Look for any initialization switches

## üîß Testing Steps

### Step 1: Physical Inspection
1. Look for any LED indicators on the robot
2. Check for physical switches or buttons
3. Verify power supply is connected and working
4. Check all cable connections

### Step 2: Power Cycle
1. Turn off the robot completely
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Turn the robot back on
4. Try the movement tests again

### Step 3: Try Different Control Modes
1. Look for mode switches on the robot
2. Try switching between different modes
3. Test movement in each mode

### Step 4: Check Robot Documentation
1. Look for the robot's manual or documentation
2. Check for specific initialization procedures
3. Verify the correct command protocol

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Robot is Stuck or Unresponsive:
1. **Emergency Stop**: Press any emergency stop button
2. **Power Off**: Turn off the robot completely
3. **Wait**: Wait 30 seconds
4. **Power On**: Turn the robot back on
5. **Test**: Try basic movement commands

### If Robot Moves Unexpectedly:
1. **Stop**: Press emergency stop immediately
2. **Check**: Verify all safety features are working
3. **Reset**: Power cycle the robot
4. **Test**: Test with simple movements first

## üìû Getting Help

If none of these steps work:
1. Check the robot manufacturer's documentation
2. Look for online forums or support groups
3. Contact the robot manufacturer's support
4. Check if there are firmware updates available

## üîç Advanced Debugging

### Check System Logs:
```bash
dmesg | grep -i usb
dmesg | grep -i serial
dmesg | grep -i i2c
```

### Check Device Permissions:
```bash
ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*
ls -la /dev/i2c*
```

### Test Hardware:
```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 0
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
```

## üí° Common Solutions

1. **Robot in Safety Mode**: Look for safety switches and enable them
2. **Wrong Control Mode**: Switch to remote/computer control mode
3. **Power Issues**: Check power supply and connections
4. **Cable Issues**: Verify all servo cables are connected
5. **Software Issues**: Try different command protocols
6. **Hardware Issues**: Check for physical damage or loose connections

## üéØ Success Indicators

The robot is working correctly when:
- ‚úÖ LED indicators are lit
- ‚úÖ Servos respond to commands
- ‚úÖ Robot moves smoothly
- ‚úÖ No error messages
- ‚úÖ Commands are acknowledged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Warnings

- Always keep emergency stop accessible
- Never leave the robot unattended during testing
- Keep hands and objects away from moving parts
- Follow all safety procedures in the robot manual
- Test with slow movements first
